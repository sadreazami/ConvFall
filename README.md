# ConvFall
Fall Detection using Standoff Radar-based Sensing and Deep Convolutional Neural Network

We propose a time series-based method for detecting fall incidents from human daily
activities. A time series in the slow-time is obtained by summing all the range bins corresponding to fast-time of the ultra
wideband radar return signals. This time series is used as input to the deep convolutional neural network for automatic
feature extraction.
